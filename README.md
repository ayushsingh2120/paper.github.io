# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

A simple **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game built using Python's `tkinter` library. This graphical application allows users to play the classic game against the computer.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Play Rock-Paper-Scissors with a graphical interface.
- **Randomized Computer Moves**: The computer's choice is generated randomly to ensure fairness.
- **Instant Feedback**: Displays the result of each round, showing both the player's and the computer's choices.
- **Simple and Intuitive UI**: Easy-to-use interface with clearly labeled buttons.

## How It Works

1. **Choose Your Move**: Click one of the three buttons (`Rock`, `Paper`, or `Scissors`).
2. **Computer's Turn**: The computer randomly selects its move.
3. **Result**: The program determines the winner and displays the result, along with the chosen moves.
